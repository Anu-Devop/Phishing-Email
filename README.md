# Phishing-Email Attack

## Objective
To design and implement a comprehensive phishing email attack simulation project, which include images that demonstrates the identification, analysis, and mitigation of phishing threats. This project aims to raise awareness of how malicious attackers can craft deceptive emails with look alike file extensions or links to establish unauthorized connections to individuals' PCs. It highlights the tactics used by attackers and showcases effective detection methods and defense strategies, ultimately enhancing understanding and resilience against phishing attacks by simulating real-world attack scenarios.

## Skills learned

1.  Social Engineering Tactics aligns with the Techniques, Tactics, and Procedures (TTPs) at the top of the Pyramid of Pain in security architecture where social engineering directly addresses human vulnerabilities, which are among the most challenging and impactful elements to defend against in cybersecurity..  therefore regular monitoring should ne mandatory in every organization

2. **Email Spoofing and Forgery**:  
   Acquire the ability to mimic trusted senders by forging email headers, addresses, and domains to make phishing emails appear legitimate.  

3. **Crafting Persuasive Content**:  
   Develop skills to write convincing phishing emails, including creating compelling subject lines, realistic messaging, and urgency-driven calls to action.  

4. **Malware and Payload Delivery**:  
   Gain knowledge about embedding malicious payloads (e.g., keyloggers, ransomware) within attachments or links while bypassing antivirus and email security filters.  

5. **Understanding and Bypassing Security Measures**:  
   Learn how email security tools (spam filters, sandboxing, etc.) work and techniques to evade detection, such as avoiding keywords that trigger spam filters or using trusted domains as camouflage.
