# Phishing-Email Attack


## Objective
To design and implement a comprehensive phishing email attack simulation project, which include images that demonstrates the identification, analysis, and mitigation of phishing threats. This project aims to raise awareness of how malicious attackers can craft deceptive emails with look alike file extensions or links to establish unauthorized connections to individuals' PCs. It highlights the tactics used by attackers and showcases effective detection methods and defense strategies, ultimately enhancing understanding and resilience against phishing attacks by simulating real-world attack scenarios.

## Steps & procedure
Gain knowledge about embedding malicious payloads (e.g., keyloggers, ransomware) within attachments or links while bypassing antivirus and email security filters.  

 Social Engineering Tactics aligns with the Techniques, Tactics, and Procedures (TTPs) at the top of the Pyramid of Pain in security architecture where social engineering directly addresses human vulnerabilities,   which are among the most challenging and impactful elements to defend against in cybersecurity.. Therefore regular monitoring should ne mandatory in every organization
 deep understanding and continuous education necessitates behavioral analytics to detect anomalies, such as unusual clicks or downloads initiated due to phishing.
