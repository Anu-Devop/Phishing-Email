# Phishing Email using social engineering


## Objective
To promote cybersecurity awareness by demsonstrting how simple it is for attackers to create and deliver a phishing website to manipulate human behavior- Tactics, Techniques and Procedures(TTPs) which is the toughest level on the Pyramid of Pain to penetrate in any organization IT security architecture.

## Steps & procedure
Embedding malicious payloads (e.g., keyloggers, ransomware) within attachments or links while bypassing antivirus and email security filters.  
Social Engineering Tactics aligns Techniques, Tactics, and Procedures (TTPs) at the top of the Pyramid of Pain in security architecture where social engineering directly addresses human vulnerabilities and human element, which are among the most challenging and impactful attack to defend against in cybersecurity.. Therefore regular monitoring should ne mandatory in every organization with deep understanding and continuous education necessitates along with behavioral analytics to detect anomalies, such as unusual clicks or downloads initiated due to phishing.
